## Work Structure:
- **planning stage**:  (5 minutes)
	- plan a small, achievable goal 
	- clearly define what "done" would look like 
- **work towards set goal** (20 minutes)
	- mindfully; minimize distractions 
	- anchored, taking care to feel myself, *without* rushing or crunching 
	- remember: the goal is the mindfulness!  
	- The set goals are pretty arbitrary. The distress of not reaching them occasionally, and not rushing myself, is part of doing the work.
	- when the alarm goes off, stop -- put it down.  I can pick it back up again after. This is also part of the practice.
- after: **reflect on process** (20 minutes)
	- did I reach my goal?
	- what barriers came up? 
	- how did I navigate them? 
	- what did I do well? 
	- what did I learn? 
	- what would I do differently?
- **break**! (15 minutes)
	- get up, move around
	- get a drink
	- stretch
	- play with Bandit 

### Reasons
* Creating **structured anchors**; removing myself from the nebulous abstract, where the neighbor thoughts play

## Goals for the process:
**1 hour work blocks**, with structured time to plan, reflect, and also stretch in between  (set alarms)

* Working on the process, more than the product
	* The results are a bonus; this is about learning more effective ways to work
* Learning how to work in ways outside of my trauma responses
	* Setting reasonable goals, and sticking to them in *healthy and sustainable* ways
	* Embracing imperfection
	* Letting things take the time they need (no panic, no crunch)
* Sticking within set goals; not moving goalposts 
* Celebrating what I accomplish
