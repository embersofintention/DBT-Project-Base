	* Neighbor thoughts scurrying around moving a football goal, while a Rapscallien trails behind struggling to keep up

	* A giant hand made out of words: the things that pull me routinely out of my own body and into that experience of deeper detachment 
	* It is smooshing a Rapscallien in its grasp as it pulls them out of Ralien. They are flailing and reaching out to grab hold of anything, eager to not let go
	* Ral's jagged hair blends in with shattered mirror cracks
