## 5:00 PM - October 30, 2025

I need to pull up **one specific memory** to use...
* Don't need to be able to recall all of the details; 
* I just need a **beginning, a middle and an end**. 

Possible options?

### Trips to the mall
Age: 3 or 4 until we moved in third grade 

Beginning: 
* Dad, brother and I would pile into the car to go have a treat as a family

Middle:
* Brother, once he got his treat, would start ignoring Dad and just walk off. 
* Dad would follow, shouting and dragging me along
* Once Dad got a hold of him he would drag us out of the mall 

End:
* He would rant, rave and shout ("like an absolute maniac," to use his own words here), all the way home.
* I remember being in the back seat, wondering if he even remembered I was there.

--
### Emotional takeaway beliefs 
*Taking the time to stick with the feelings and capture them, rather than evade and suppress the discomfort...* 

**I took the following beliefs from these experiences:**

* I was an afterthought.  
	* When things trigger Dad's anxiety, he becomes pretty much unable to process anything outside of wanting to make the trigger stop.  (We've talked about this in our adult relationship)
	* In those moments, given the objective context of what I know now, I feel it's very fair to say that I temporarily *did* stop existing on his radar. 
* It did not matter how well behaved I was.  
	* I would end these trips feeling terrified, alone, emotionally abandoned, and not sure what I was doing wrong
* Positive feelings were risky, if not dangerous
* My parents were only able to love me when he wasn't around 
	* Or more specifically, only able to care about me enough to love me?


> [!info] I left these situations with a certainty -- that any time my brother was around or involved, my parents loved me less.


**I know this not to be true now:**
- There can realistically only be so much mental and emotional energy to give. Between his needs and his absolute refusal to cooperate, my brother would quickly and regularly drain that well. 


**However, this was consistently reinforced through my childhood...**
* When he was involved, their worlds revolved around him. 
* They (understandably) did not have the energy to fully realize me at the same time
* and his needs were far more obvious than mine.. so I became the kid who *needed* to just be fine.  



**We've talked since.** 
I understand the situation far better, and honestly, I very much understand how they were doing the very best that they could with what they knew, and the tools they had.  

**They *never* didn't love me.** 

Actually, they loved me a lot more than I ever would have expected.  And in our adult relationships, **this is incredibly clear to me now**.  




### The harms of bad professional advice
Part of me wishes so much that we could have gotten better advice when I was younger.  
* ***They tried very hard to find answers*** for why my mental health spiraled so far downwards, from the loving and joyful little kid to everything that followed 
* **the advice that professionals gave them was completely wrong**, and made things far worse for all of us.  -- but the fact that they cared about me enough to get there in the first place speaks volumes to me. 
	* I could not have reasonably understood that their intentions were out of love from the position that I was in, given the context of my perspective and experiences.
	* They could not have reasonably understood that the things they were being told when they sought professional *help* for my situation could actually be so profoundly damaging instead
* We all loved each other 
* We all kept trying the best that we could
* We *never* gave up or stopped trying to make things okay
* We stuck with one another



> [!info] This fuels my determination to create things to help families, and kids, learn ways to navigate emotional challenges 


## 20:07 -- something that I'm just now putting together 

When I was sick or hurt, i would become a priority, regardless of whatever else was going on.
* This was *especially* true for Dad, who was deeply expressive with his love in those times. 

Connection with sticky beliefs..?
* I felt that I was *supposed* to hurt.. That was when I was most guaranteed that they would care about me.

> ***These moments were when I would be seen for the reality of my own experience and validated for it**,  while much of the time otherwise felt like a minefield in those regards. 

 I often feel like I'm supposed to hurt, and that good feelings aren't something I should allow myself to be comfortable in for long. 
 
 ...**Do I associate feeling okay with stepping away from my ability to be loved?** I might need to think about this a bit
