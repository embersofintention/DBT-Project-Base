Except, maybe it being that way could be part of his overall back story?

--

Since he's an uplifted opossum, I imagine his Wanderborn community might have found him and taken him in as more of a novelty than as an equal, at least at first.  Like a pet or a mascot.  Maybe they found him as a pup, wounded and left behind, and it was one individual's passion project to nurse him back to health. 

And as part of that attempt, best intentions overshadowed sound judgments and that person figured, that one really weird mushroom person in the clan who never seems to wanna talk with anyone, he's weird but definitely seems oddly immune to lasting harm.  Maybe he could help...? 

So this kid or whoever, they brought the little opossum to the shroom man.  

It took a bit of doing, but eventually the strange old shroom-man feels some sense of empathy for them.  It's an awful feeling to watch something you love suffer and die.. A feeling he knew all too well.  (Some potential for an interesting NPC with some stuff to play with in that one, I think).  

Shroomman saves the Opossum by connecting him to the essence of the mycelium and all the weirdness that may come with that.  The three of them spend a lot of time together from there, as Shroomman helps him heal, and teaches them both all sorts of interesting mushroomy wisdom.
Including how to use some of that magic in him now to communicate, both with all sorts of other creatures and with the people as well




As an extra layer of spice for a campaign about illicit moon drugs, it could totally be psychedelic mushrooms growing on / in him, too.  

Rolling with how his thing with Luna is having his dreams be weird, indecipherable communications from her, that could be pulled in really well there too?  He's just a little guy being pulled in strange directions, with one paw in very different worlds that he isn't even equipped to understand in the first place.  
Sentience? Dreams? Visions? What is any of this, really?  
What's even *actually* real..? Because not too long ago, absolutely *none* of this was for him -- he was just an opossum.  

One minute, trying to shuffle across a street after a snack or something.  Then car, and experiencing his own death.  Then... Brought back from the brink, with visions of the *moon...?* Too much for a little guy who just wanted to enjoy some nice grubs, he'd say.  But here we are.




But yeah, psychedelic mushrooms, weird visions at night, weird intuitions during the day, never quite sure of what reality is because none of it fits quite naturally for him anymore.  

And I'm thinking actually, what if we worked some of that vibe and homebrewed a thing to work "playing possum" into a game mechanic? Like some kind of fake death where he internally communes with the mycelium network and speaks with them for guidance?

I could see them having started off as a family unit, and grown into more of a broader group / clan type thing from taking others in over time. I like that idea of them all just trying to take care of people who seem to have fallen between society's cracks.

Are there skills down the road that allow a character to be in touch with death / the dead?  
It could be interesting to have him fall further over time into his grip on reality blurring, as the death he didn't ask to cheat like that starts to show that it never fully untangled him from its ice cold tendrils
