The sight of his mistress brought Ravel to his knees. Figuratively, at least; at the moment he was far too busy readying her favorite chair with all the things she enjoyed most.  A pillow he had given her, made rich with his scent through all of their nights spent in their forbidden embrace.  A blanket lined with soft hide, to drape over its edges.  Another for her lap, should she so choose.  

Though as he thought about this last addition, a smile tugged at his face.. They'd soon be far too busy for that.  
And her lap, *hopefully*, too well occupied.
