This is a concept that I find myself coming back to pretty often now, and it's been especially helpful for me:   

**When I feel myself getting stuck** in an emotion (or a rumination cycle, or an executive dysfunction freeze-up, etcetera), I've been trying to simply asking myself... *What could an alternative to this look like?*  
--

What could it look like if I weren't afraid?  
What would it look like if I were able to move how I want to right now?
What could I find myself doing instead if I weren't stuck ruminating on these things? 

--

And this becomes a perfect opportunity to [[2 - Rapscalliens WIP|involve my own Rapscalliens]] directly, inviting them to show me their own answers to these questions as I ask them.  
Sometimes, being able to really vividly conceptualize where we could be if we weren't so trapped can be just enough to help get out of it -- or at least, maybe free us up a little bit more room to think, so we can start engaging other skills to get there.
