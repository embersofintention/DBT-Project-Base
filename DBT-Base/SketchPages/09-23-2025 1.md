(...or the magical anime girls)

Sometimes my sketch journal pages end up with notes and such that aren't really meant to be "part of a presentation", but y'know, I'm gonna just leave some of them in here.  I feel like it reinforces the reality that this isn't meant to be "content" or anything, y'know?  

It's authenticity.  

A messy, scribbly, rambling, occasionally incoherent collection of sketched down thoughts, that I want to invite you to see and be a part of.

Also I guess I should give some context to that magical anime girls line, right?  Haha. 
I was having a conversation with my (very excellent) doctor, and we were talking about intrusive thoughts.  It came up to assign them a visualization of sorts, as a tool to help mentally conceptualize them.  

He suggested that adding a layer of absurdity can kinda rob them of a bit of their power, making them less intimidating when they do decide to rear their ~~ugly little~~ heads -- I think I can confidently say that this would be the first time I've ever had magical anime girls come up in a clinical setting, lol.  So naturally I had to cast that into immortality on the page, and here we are.

After this I mentioned that I'd been scribbling the visualization that'd come into my head as we'd been talking, and shared the weird little dudes.  This wound up being the beginning of our starting to use my ~~penchant for shitposting~~ *use of creating my own visual metaphors for the concepts I'm trying to process* as a part of our approach to helping me, and I feel like that was a really powerful shift in direction.
