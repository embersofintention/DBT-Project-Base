### Meet the **Rapscalliens** - tools to separate the Self from our Thoughts and Emotions

**This becomes an excellent opportunity** to use all of these little figurative visualization metaphors of mine as well:  It becomes easier **to gently place myself into the role of the Curious Observer**, the Self, which *is a different thing* than the thoughts and feelings and boisterous emotions that can sometimes otherwise dominate our conscious experience.  

Because **it can be pretty difficult sometimes to remember that we are not our thoughts or emotions, that we are not defined by them.**.. And it helps to have all the tools to bring ourselves back to this understanding that we can get.  


SO, I might take a few quiet moments aside, and make a note of what I'm feeling.  Separate it out into the individual thoughts, and individual emotions.  
Then for each one, I'll imagine a Rapscallien.  
Each one gets its own bit of time to introduce itself if it likes, telling me a little something about itself and what feels most important to it right then that I should know.
