# Information 
---
## **A. Situation** 
Describe the **event**, thought or belief leading to the unpleasant emotion(s): 

* X

---
## **B. Belief / Stuck Point**
### Thoughts
What do you notice the automatic **Neighbor Thoughts** yelling at you the most?  

* X

### Beliefs
What are the **Beliefs behind them**, and how believable do they *feel* right now? 
*(Note: not intellectually; don't try to rationalize it)* 
-- Rate from 0-100

* X

---
## **C. Emotions (part 1)**
Practice **mindfulness of current emotions**: As you think about those thoughts and beliefs, **what are you feeling,** and **how intensely are you feeling it?** 
-- Rate from 0-100

* X


---

# Curiosity 
---

## **D. Challenging Thoughts**
Use **challenging questions** to examine your automatic thought from section B. 
*(With curiosity, and without judgement)*

### Evidence in support?
*What feels like it supports the belief?  (Don't worry about it being right or wrong; write down what you're feeling, free of judgement).  

* X
### Evidence against? 
*Things suggesting that the thought may not be based in what's happening right now?

* X
### Habit? Or a Fact?
*Is the neighbor thought *fueled by inertia* / because you've been thinking it for a long time? Or is there clear, demonstrable evidence for it?

* X
### Not including all the relevant information?
*what related information may the thought be leaving out?*

* X
### All or nothing thinking? 
*Do the thoughts include words like "always", "never", etc?*

* X
### Extreme or exaggerated?
*Do you notice a lot of "needs", "musts", "shoulds" and "have to's"?*

* X
### Focused on just one piece of information?
*Do you get those **"Yeah But" Thoughts**, minimizing other parts of it? ("Yeah I see that, but it doesn't matter because this part is more important")*

* X
### Is the source of that thought dependable/reliable?
*With invalidation: are they reliable judges? Would you trust their expertise on this matter?*

* X
### Conflating possibility with likelihood?
*Does it have you focusing on things that are very unlikely to happen, at the cost of falling behind on things that are happening now?*

* X
### Based on feelings, or facts?
*Look back at the Evidence For -- is it Emotional? Abstract? Non-concrete? Unspecific? If so, chances are it's based on feelings and habit rather than fact.*

* X
### Focused on unrelated parts?
*Are details coming in that don't actually speak to what was going on in this situation?* 

* X

## **E. Problematic Patterns** 
Looking at whether we're falling into **thinking traps.**
(These can be answered yes or no, *or* you can use this space to write out your thoughts and work through it)
* **Jumping to conclusions?**
* **Exaggerating or minimizing?**
* **Ignoring important parts?**
* **Oversimplifying?**
* **Overgeneralizing?**
* **Mind reading?** Do you feel like you know what someone is thinking or feeling? What their intentions are? What they meant, when they didn't tell you directly?
* **Emotional reasoning?**  --  for example: *"if I feel guilty/ashamed, it must be because there is something to be ashamed of"*  (Note: If based on feelings and not facts, this one is probably yes)

# Reconsideration 
---


## **F. Alternative Thoughts**
>*(Balancing the difficulty that you experienced with a **more inclusive awareness** of your goals and of your own experiences)

Now how do you feel? 
*Rate each from 0-100
* X

# Extra Bits
---
## Feel your feelings (don't just rationalize!) 

>[!info] Remember as you're working to **connect with your emotions,** and not just process them rationally!

Without that piece it stays as just a thought exercise, and can't be as effective -- things will likely just snap back to where they were right after.

Here are a couple things to help you out:

>**Give extra mindfulness to the emotion parts** (especially sections C and H)...
>* allow yourself to feel the things *without judgement* 
>* There are no right or wrong answers, and no feelings that are forbidden to have



> **If you feel internal resistance pushing back** when being present with a feeling... 
> * take a pause 
> * stay with it
> * be curious about it
> * explore it
> * **Write through your thought process as you go** -- any section of these work notes can be expanded to add processing!

## **"Foot out the door effect"**
-- when one foot is already out the door and all focus falls on that urge to leave, and we can forget that one foot is still inside though, and we're still doing the thing.
