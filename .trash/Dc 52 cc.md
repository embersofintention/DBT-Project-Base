# Diary Card Entry:
## `=this.file.ctime`


 context::". Thinking about my visual metaphor of the Black Dogs Of Despair"


Ralien sitting on a porch, watching the Rapscalliens running around to play 
* Ral observes them and what they're doing, calmly describing what he's taking in to the dogs all around him
* Ralien is directing the emotional temperature of the situation, through his mindful inclusion of each Part and their own individual emotional needs
	* The Black Dogs are calm. They feel seen, acknowledged, included, valued for their presence, and therefore don't feel their need to act protectively.  
	* As with real dogs, they have a hard time when they don't have a stable hierarchy and established boundaries. 
	* They will act up, testing the limits of those around them as they try to figure it out.
	* Each can think of itself as not only in charge, but responsible for the safety of their situation.  ...Which can lead into dangerous behavior, that really doesn't help themselves or the things they're trying to protect.  (The urge usually does not fit the best interests of their situation, when their situation involves people).
