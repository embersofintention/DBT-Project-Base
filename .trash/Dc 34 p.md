# Diary Card Entry:
## `=this.file.ctime`
Processing through the swirl of thoughts and emotions in my head, after yesterday's scares and waking up today from triggering nightmares

 context::"  "


### recalling the nightmare

* I was in my teens again I think, or around there at least

During that time irl
* I had carried a lot of anxiety about being stuck places, unable to get away or feel safe, and wasn't permitted to start learning how to drive until much later than the other kids, cementing that sense of otherness. 
* (Sitting in driver's ed and being older by at least a year than the others was humiliating, even as I was excited to be there. 
* Confusing contrasts were the theme growing up honestly)

..... I keep dozing in and out and losing the trail of my thoughts right now  

And I just woke up from one such 
Worries about getting hit with g)iant hospital bills
